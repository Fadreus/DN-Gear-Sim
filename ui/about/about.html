    <h4>How is average damage calculated and what is eqhp?</h4>
    <p>
      Something like:
      <pre>damage = element% x skill% x fd% x (avg(dmg) + ((crit dmg-100%) x crit chance x 0.75 x avg(dmg)))</pre>
      I assume enemies have a flat 25% crit resist (which is where 0.75 comes from).
      I assume no element resistance since usually you will have resist reduction debuffers in your party.
      If you want to see the full calculations in the code these are in statService.js
      <pre>eqhp = ( (hp / (1-pdef%)) + (hp / (1-mdef%)) ) / 2</pre>
      eqhp is equivalent hp.
      This is essentially the amount of damage you will take before you die.
      It takes both hp and defence into acount.
      There is magic and phisical defence so I work out both magic and physical eqhp and show the average.

    <h4>Some skills do not work correctly?</h4>
    <p>
      I have implemented many skills now however there numerous classes I do not play.
      Feel free to get in touch if you want to work with me to implement any extra skill for your class.
    </p>
    <h4>What is with all these items that do not exist in-game?</h4>
    <p>
      I show almost everything I can from the data files.
      Many items may not exist also some items have duplicates.
      This is useful to see what is coming but keep in mind that the stats of items can change with future updates.
    </p>
    <h4>How is the data stored?</h4>
    <p>
      Unless published builds are not saved to the server so may be lost if your browser is reset.
      If you want to keep any builds without logging in you can export them as links or json files that can be shared and imported into another browser.
      When you log in your log in to publish your build your details are stored with google firebase.
    </p>
    <h4>Growth spirits cannot be enhanced?</h4>
    <p>
      Stats for this are random so please create a custom item with the stats you get.
    </p>
    <h4>Why are the calcuations not accurate?</h4>
    <p>
      I believe they are - or at least out only by a tiny bit.
      If your stats are marginally different most likely you are missing some item or passive skill, etc.
      Feel free to ask if things do not look right.
      If you publish your build I can have a look to see if there is a glitch that needs fixing.
