I redirected all users to https.
This means that if your builds were saved in the http version of the site they will not show up.
Do not worry as you will be able to recover them using the new import/export function.
Go <a href="http://spacem.github.io/dngearsim-recover">here</a> to export your builds then import them from the builds page.
