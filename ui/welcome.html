<h3>some news <small>and a request for help</small></h3>

Soon I will redirect all users to https.
This means that if your builds were saved in the http version of the site they will not show up.
Do not worry as you will be able to recover them using the new import/export function.
<!--
Go <a href="http://spacem.github.io/dngearsim-recover">here</a> to export your builds then import them from the builds page.

I am looking for a volunteer to help to supply data for the korean region.
I have the game installed but cannot update.
If anyone can help out please contact me via my <a href="https://discord.gg/011C92KwJWoCfRcEY">discord server</a>.
Please note I am looking specifically a volunteer - not just names of people who play on the kdn server.

It is one year now since I released the first version of dngearsim.
The site has grown a lot over the year and you can look forward to more improvments in future.
