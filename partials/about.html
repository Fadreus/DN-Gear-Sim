<h3><small>how do I use this?</small></h3>

  Start by searching for equipment.
  Click items to view details then save items from the seach into a group.
  Edit saved groups to set a level and class to see extra calcualted stats.
  Saved groups are not saved to the server so may be lost if your browser is reset.
  If you want to keep any groups you can export them as links that can be shared and imported into another browser.

<h3><small>what about other regions?</small></h3>
<p>
  Use the toggles in the top right to change regions.
  The language and data is controlled separatly.

<h3><small>what are the strange items?</small></h3>
